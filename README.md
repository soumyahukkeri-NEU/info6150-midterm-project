Website will have a minimum of 6 pages.

● At least 1 home page named index.html. This page is the entry page of your web
application. You will need to tell your potential clients why they should choose you, what
are the top destinations you provide, and if there are any deals or discounts. For any
deals or top destinations, make sure to provide a link to another page of your website so
that they can click and get more details.

● Your company has expanded to provide at least 3 destinations. You will build one page
for each destination. Each page will have an introduction to the destination and one or
more several-day itineraries. Make the page look appealing by adding some images and
organize the pictures nicely.

● There will be a page for the reservation form just like you did in HW 5. When the user
clicks Submit, the page will need to show all the data they entered right below the
Submit button. Hint: You will need to use JavaScript to get information from DOM and
add new elements to the DOM.

● Make sure all the pages include some common components such as top / side nav bar,
footer, etc.

● If you copy the content from other websites, make sure to include citations.
